    Our main Page allows users to get to know what our company is about, it sets up links to sign up or login if they already have an account
    and tells them what this website is about but how company came about. If they have any questions, we have a button "talk to us"
    to let them reach out to us with any concerns in the contact form below. We set up 5 sections for the main page so that it would be easier
    for users to get the information they needed instead of clicking a bunch of links to get them what they want. 

    How we did the gradient background for our index section was by using CSS. Under the function background I used the property "linear-gradient"
    and choose the colours we wanted to use on the website. After the colours are choosen I used an animation property so that it switches between 
    the colours infinite. 

    How the contact form was created was by creating a form and then labeling every inout we needed from them such as name, email and etc. 
    We also set up a select option for country, at the moment we only have 3 options for country but they can select any of the 3 when completing the form.

    The whole main page was mainly focussed on styling through our CSS file, and includes all the little things such as a hover over a button, the background,
    and the transition from which section which we used svg to create that cut slick look for a smooth transition. What we used in our main, we then took to 
    use to help implement our other pages as well to keep a theme.
